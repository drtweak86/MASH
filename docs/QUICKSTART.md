# MASH Quick Start Guide 🚀

Get Fedora running on your Raspberry Pi 4 in minutes.

---

## ⬇️ Download MASH

MASH is distributed as a single prebuilt binary for Linux aarch64 (for Raspberry Pi 4B).

1.  **Download the latest binary:**
    Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/drtweak86/MASH/releases/latest) and download the file named `mash-linux-aarch64`.

    *(For Raspberry Pi 4B users, this is the binary you need.)*

2.  **Make it executable and run:**
    Open a terminal, navigate to your download directory, and run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x mash-linux-aarch64
    sudo ./mash-linux-aarch64
    ```
    *(Remember, MASH needs `sudo` for disk operations.)*

## ⚠️ Before You Begin

**This installer will ERASE your target disk completely.**

- Back up any important data first
- Double-check your disk device name
- There is no undo

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### For Building from Source or If Binaries Require System Dependencies

If you are building MASH from source, or if you encounter issues running the prebuilt binary (e.g., missing shared libraries), you may need these packages installed on your Linux host:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install parted rsync xz-utils dosfstools e2fsprogs btrfs-progs

# Fedora
sudo dnf install parted rsync xz dosfstools e2fsprogs btrfs-progs

# Arch
sudo pacman -S parted rsync xz dosfstools e2fsprogs btrfs-progs
```

### Target Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- SD card or USB drive (minimum 8 GB, recommended 32+ GB)
- HDMI cable, keyboard, and mouse for first boot

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Identify Your Target Disk

Connect your SD card or USB drive and identify it:

```bash
lsblk
```

Example output:
```
NAME        SIZE  TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
sda         32G   disk            ← Your SD card (USE THIS)
├─sda1       1G   part
└─sda2      31G   part
nvme0n1    500G   disk            ← System drive (DON'T USE!)
├─nvme0n1p1  1G   part  /boot/efi
└─nvme0n1p2 499G  part  /
```

**Common disk names:**
- SD card in USB reader: `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`
- SD card in built-in slot: `/dev/mmcblk0`
- USB drive: `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`
- NVMe (usually your system — avoid!): `/dev/nvme0n1`

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Run MASH

### Option A: Interactive TUI (Recommended)

Launch the Dojo UI and follow the prompts:

```bash
sudo mash
```

The TUI guides you through:
1. Selecting your target disk
2. Choosing image source (download or local)
3. Selecting partition scheme (MBR recommended)
4. Confirming you have backed up your data (required)
5. Creating your first-boot user (no autologin)
6. Final confirmation before flashing

Defaults: MBR scheme, EFI 1 GiB, BOOT 2 GiB, ROOT end 1800 GiB, DATA remainder.

### Option B: CLI Mode (For Automation)

Run with all options on the command line:

```bash
sudo mash flash \
  --disk /dev/sda \
  --scheme mbr \
  --download-image \
  --download-uefi \
  --auto-unmount \
  --yes-i-know
```

This will:
1. Download Fedora 43 KDE image
2. Download latest UEFI firmware
3. Partition and format `/dev/sda`
4. Install Fedora with UEFI boot

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test First (Optional but Recommended)

Run a dry-run to see what would happen without making changes:

```bash
sudo mash flash \
  --disk /dev/sda \
  --scheme mbr \
  --download-image \
  --download-uefi \
  --auto-unmount \
  --yes-i-know \
  --dry-run
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Installation

After flashing completes, verify the partitions:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/sda print
```

You should see 4 partitions:
```
Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
 1      1049kB  1075MB  1074MB  primary  fat32        boot, esp
 2      1075MB  3222MB  2147MB  primary  ext4
 3      3222MB  1933GB  1930GB  primary  btrfs
 4      1933GB  2000GB  67.1GB  primary  ext4
```

---

## 🔌 Step 5: First Boot

1. **Safely eject** the SD card/USB drive from your host
2. **Insert** into your Raspberry Pi 4
3. **Connect** HDMI, keyboard, and mouse
4. **Power on** the Pi

The system should boot to:
- UEFI firmware screen briefly
- GRUB bootloader
- Fedora KDE desktop

On first boot, the **MASH Dojo** TUI runs once to finish setup. To rerun it later:
```bash
sudo rm /var/lib/mash/dojo.completed
sudo systemctl enable --now mash-dojo.service
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No TTY detected"

MASH TUI requires an interactive terminal:
```bash
# Run directly in terminal
sudo mash

# Won't work via pipe
cat | sudo mash  # ❌
```

### "Permission denied"

Always run with sudo:
```bash
sudo mash
```

### "Disk is busy" / "Target is mounted"

Unmount all partitions first:
```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda*
```

Or use `--auto-unmount` flag.

### "Image file not found"

Verify your image path:
```bash
ls -lh ~/Downloads/*.raw
```

Use the full absolute path, or use `--download-image` to auto-download.

### UEFI boot fails

- Ensure your Pi has UEFI firmware (not default U-Boot)
- Try re-flashing with `--download-uefi` to get latest firmware
- Check that EFI partition has `BOOTAA64.EFI` in correct location

### Boot hangs at black screen

- Ensure adequate power supply (5V/3A)
- Try MBR scheme if GPT doesn't work: `--scheme mbr`
- Check HDMI cable and monitor compatibility

## 🎉 Post-Installation

After first boot, you may want to:

```bash
# Update system
sudo dnf update -y

# Set up WiFi
nmtui

# Enable SSH for remote access
sudo systemctl enable --now sshd

# Create your user account
sudo useradd -m -G wheel yourusername
sudo passwd yourusername
```
