# v1.3.1 "Ferrari" Release Notes

This release sharpens the documentation, UX muscle, and release hygiene so that MASH feels like a premium experience on Raspberry Pi 4.

## Highlights
- **Dojo Program Catalogue**: curated categories with a default+alternatives model now appear in the Training Ground experience; see `docs/dojo/catalogue_content_proposal.md` for the entire schema and offerings.
- **OS image hygiene**: Fedora remains the recommended image while Ubuntu Desktop, Manjaro, and Raspberry Pi OS download pages are verified daily via `.github/workflows/os-download-links.yml` and documented in `docs/OS_IMAGE_LINKS.md`.
- **Test coverage audit**: we documented the coverage gaps in `docs/coverage/test_coverage_audit.md`, spun up download helpers (#46), and outlined the remaining coverage roadmap (#47/#48) so regressions are easier to catch.
- **Repository hygiene & policy**: ABB branch discipline, `.gitignore` cleanup, and the branch-management guide in `docs/RELEASING.md` (plus the cargo profile tweaks in #38) keep local iterations fast and safe.

## Details
- **Training Ground narrative**: `docs/DOJO.md` now links to the catalog, and `docs/QUICKSTART.md` references the curated Dojo/TG experience alongside the optional OS download guidance.
- **Documentation refresh**: README, Quick Start, Deployment, Release, and Roadmap all point to the new docs and badges so contributors understand the latest workflow and UI naming.
- **Automation & tooling**: `tools/os-link-checker` plus CI coverage automation (#45/#43) and the `issue/38` profile optimizations reduce rebuild time and keep OS links accurate.

## Testing & validation
Run the standard commands to verify the release:
