# Legacy Scripts Archive

This directory is an **archive** of historical shell/Python scripts that preceded the Rust-based MASH installer.

Status:
- **Deprecated**: not used by the current installer.
- **Reference-only**: preserved for investigation/debugging of historical behavior.

## Consolidation Note

As of 2026-02-03, the repository previously contained two legacy script trees:
- `legacy/scripts/`
- `legacy_scripts/`

These were consolidated into this single archive directory to reduce duplication and confusion.

## Contents

- `HISTORY/` contains curated markdown “history/diff” notes.
- `Holy Loop/` and other folders contain historical variants.
- `README.original.MD` is an original archived file retained verbatim.
