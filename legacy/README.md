# Legacy / Reference Code 🗃️

This directory contains historical and experimental code that informed the
current MASH installer design.

**Nothing in `legacy/` is executed by the installer.**
It exists for:
- design rationale / archaeology
- future refactors
- “why we stopped doing it that way” answers

If you’re looking for the active implementation, start here:
- `install.sh`
- `mash-installer/`

## Legacy Scripts

The historical script archive lives at `archive/legacy_scripts/`.
